      <P>The Service is provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, LookThroughProfits, Inc. disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties arising from course of dealing or usage of trade.</P>
      <P>We do not warrant that the Service will be accurate, complete, reliable, error-free, secure, or uninterrupted, or that any defects will be corrected.</P>
      <P>We do not warrant that Reports or data will be real-time or that any output will match third-party sources (including broker statements or data providers).</P>

      <D />
      <SectionHeading>Limitation of Liability</SectionHeading>
      <P>To the maximum extent permitted by law, LookThroughProfits, Inc. and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, affiliates, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business interruption, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</P>
      <P>In all cases, LookThroughProfits, Inc.&rsquo;s total liability arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid to us for the Service in the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim or (b) USD $100.</P>
      <P>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages or warranties, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law (for example, liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct where such limitation is prohibited).</P>

      <D />
      <SectionHeading>Indemnification</SectionHeading>
      <P>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless LookThroughProfits, Inc. and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, affiliates, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of or related to:</P>

      <SubHeading>Venue</SubHeading>
      <P>Except where prohibited by applicable law, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</P>

      <SubHeading>Mandatory consumer rights preserved</SubHeading>
      <P>Nothing in these Terms is intended to waive consumer statutory rights that cannot be waived under applicable law.</P>
      <P><strong>Qu&eacute;bec consumers:</strong> Certain contract terms (including mandatory arbitration clauses, certain restrictions on class actions, and foreign choice-of-law clauses) may be prohibited for consumer contracts, and rules may apply to unilateral amendments and cancellation rights. To the extent Qu&eacute;bec consumer protection law applies, the relevant mandatory provisions control.</P>
      <P><strong>Ontario consumers:</strong> Ontario consumer protection law limits the enforceability of terms that require arbitration in a way that prevents consumers from commencing certain court actions and preserves consumers&rsquo; ability to participate in class proceedings despite contractual terms to the contrary. To the extent Ontario consumer protection law applies, the relevant mandatory provisions control.</P>

      <D />
      <SectionHeading>Changes to These Terms</SectionHeading>
      <P>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide reasonable notice (for example, by posting notice on the Website or by emailing account holders).
